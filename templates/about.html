      <p>Your health is our top priority. We understand that healthcare can be complex, so we not only provide accurate predictions but also detailed information about diseases, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</p>
  
      <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
      <p>We aim to enhance our system by:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Developing a mobile app using <strong>React Native</strong>.</li>
          <li>Integrating <strong>Generative AI</strong> for advanced health predictions.</li>
          <li>Adding messaging features using <strong>Appwrite & Twilio</strong> for better patient-doctor communication.</li>
      </ul>
